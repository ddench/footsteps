{"name":"Footsteps","tagline":"EYFS tracking and evidence management system","body":"### Welcome to Footsteps GitHub Page.\r\nThis page provides development links to the tools and code used in creating Footsteps. The primary audience is developers rather than users. If you are a user looking for help, please see the section below titled Wiki.\r\n\r\nThanks for looking and happy coding!\r\n\r\n### Wiki\r\nThe Wiki is the primary point for any documentation. If you are a user please choose this link to the correct pages.\r\n\r\nIf you are interested in helping us to develop Footsteps, please choose this link\r\n\r\n(they both point ot different areas of the same Wiki)\r\n\r\n### Rather Drive Stick?\r\nIf you prefer to not use the automatic generator, push a branch named `gh-pages` to your repository to create a page manually. In addition to supporting regular HTML content, GitHub Pages support Jekyll, a simple, blog aware static site generator written by our own Tom Preston-Werner. Jekyll makes it easy to create site-wide headers and footers without having to copy them across every page. It also offers intelligent blog support and other advanced templating features.\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nYou can @mention a GitHub username to generate a link to their profile. The resulting `<a>` element will link to the contributor's GitHub Profile. For example: In 2007, Chris Wanstrath (@defunkt), PJ Hyett (@pjhyett), and Tom Preston-Werner (@mojombo) founded GitHub.\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with Pages? Check out the documentation at http://help.github.com/pages or contact support@github.com and weâ€™ll help you sort it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
